## âœ… The Correct Approach

To fix this, you need the child component to render immediately (so it can emit formReady),

but hide its own form content until itâ€™s loaded.

Youâ€™ll still show a global loader in the parent, but now itâ€™s driven by the childâ€™s event.

ðŸ§  Why This Works

Now the <app-child> renders immediately.

Its ngOnInit() runs â†’ triggers formReady.emit() after 800ms.

Parent receives the event â†’ sets isLoading = false â†’ removes spinne

```
Donâ€™t wrap your <app-child> inside the *ngIf="!isLoading".
The child must mount first to emit the ready signal.
```

âœ… When app loads:

Spinner shows (parent) while child initializes.

After ~800ms, form loads, formReady emitted â†’ spinner hides.

You see a clean, enterprise-grade form with validation, layout, and Material polish.
## Bad Approch, which never works

Initially, isLoading = true, so Angular renders the else loader block.

The app-child component is not created yet (because itâ€™s inside the *ngIf="!isLoading").

Since the child never gets created, its ngOnInit() never runs â†’

it never calls formReady.emit() â†’

parent never receives the event â†’

loader stays forever. ðŸ˜…
